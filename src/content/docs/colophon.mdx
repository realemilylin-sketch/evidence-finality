title: Credits & Build
description: Build notes, tooling, and how this documentation system is maintained.
---

**Definition.** Credits & Build records how the site is constructed and maintained so the work remains verifiable and reproducible.

This matters because reference projects gain authority not from volume, but from traceability: where the work lives, how it is built, and what changes over time.

This page lists the tools used, the publishing approach, and the minimal metadata conventions that keep the system stable.

## Technology

- Built with **Astro** and **Starlight**  
- Theme: **Flexoki** for long-form readability  
- Content format: Markdown/MDX in a structured docs collection  

## Publishing approach

- Pages prioritize stability over frequency.  
- Revisions are allowed, but the goal is to preserve conceptual continuity rather than rewrite history.  
- Overview pages act as entry points for each layer and may be updated more often than leaf pages.

## Content conventions

- Every page has a clear `title` and a short `description`.  
- Key pages begin with a three-part opening: **Definition → Why it matters → What this page gives**.  
- Slugs should remain stable once published to avoid link decay.
