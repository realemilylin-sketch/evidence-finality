title: Overview
description: When continuation inside an environment becomes non-neutral.
---

**Definition.** Conditions describes threshold states: the point at which continuing inside an environment stops being neutral and begins to reshape posture of judgment.

This matters because many environments are not “bad,” but they are not stable either. They delay decision-making, distort patience, and change what people will tolerate—without ever announcing themselves as a problem.

This page will give you a way to recognize when an environment has crossed from background into active influence.

## What Conditions covers

This layer focuses on:

- Delay and drift (when spaces slow judgment without clarity)
- Non-neutral continuation (when staying changes what “reasonable” feels like)
- Threshold cues (signals that the environment is now shaping outcomes)
