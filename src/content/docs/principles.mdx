title: Principles
description: What this site is, and what it is not.
---

**Definition.** Principles states the editorial constraints of the project: what qualifies as a valid claim, and what does not.

This matters because “interior design” content is often opinion-driven. If the site is to function as a stable reference, it needs rules that prevent drift into trends, taste, or personal branding.

This page defines the writing stance, what counts as evidence here, and the boundaries that keep the system coherent.

## What this site is

- A vocabulary for describing **pre-judgment** spatial influence  
- A framework for **slow-acting** environmental regulation  
- A structure that treats interiors as **conditions**, not expressions  

## What this site is not

- Not a catalog of styles  
- Not a set of decorating tips  
- Not a collection of case studies  
- Not a prescriptive checklist for “better design”  

## What counts as a valid page

A page should be expressible as a **condition** that remains meaningful across contexts.

If a claim depends primarily on preference (“I like / I don’t like”), short-term trends, or personal identity signaling, it is usually excluded.

## Language stance

This project favors definitions over adjectives.

When a term is used, it should be usable as a **reference**: something another person could cite, test, or apply without inheriting the author’s taste.
