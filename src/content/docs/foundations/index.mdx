title: Overview
description: First principles for describing space as a background condition.
---

**Definition.** Foundations defines the base vocabulary of The Space As: what it means to treat interiors as conditions rather than expressions.

This matters because without first principles, later claims about “calm,” “fatigue,” or “influence” collapse into taste and opinion. Foundations keeps the system stable across styles, cultures, and revision cycles.

This page will give you the conceptual ground needed to read the rest of the site without treating it as decoration advice.

## What Foundations covers

Foundations is where the project makes its core commitments:

- Background conditions shape judgment before conscious decision-making.
- Interiors regulate perception over time, not only at first glance.
- “Neutral” is not the absence of influence; it is often an unmeasured influence.

## What to read first in Foundations

If you only read two pages to understand the stance:

1. **Space as Psychological Infrastructure**
2. **Why Space Is Never Neutral**

Then read:

3. **Space Is Felt Before It Is Seen**
