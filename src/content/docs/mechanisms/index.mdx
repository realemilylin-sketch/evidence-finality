title: Overview
description: How slow-acting influence accumulates through surfaces, light behavior, and visual load.
---

**Definition.** Mechanisms explains how interiors exert slow, cumulative influence: the repeatable processes that turn “background” into regulation.

This matters because most environmental effects are not caused by a single object or a single color choice. They are caused by accumulation—light behavior over time, surface load, and visual density that never lets perception rest.

This page will give you a map of the main processes the site uses to explain why a space feels stable, tiring, or quietly directive.

## What Mechanisms covers

Common mechanism families in this system:

- Light behavior (reflection, glare, diffusion, bounce)
- Surface load (pattern frequency, edges, micro-contrast)
- Visual density (how much the eye must resolve per second)
- Time-based regulation (how effects compound during continued exposure)

## Recommended first sequence in Mechanisms

1. **Slow-Acting Background Regulation**
2. **Visual Density and Cognitive Load**
3. **Color Temperature Over Time**
