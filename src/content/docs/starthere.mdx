description: How to navigate the system and what to read first.

**Definition.** Reading Guide is the shortest path through the system: a map that tells you what each layer does and what to read first.

This matters because the site is designed as a documentation structure, not a timeline. Without a guided path, readers often treat pages as isolated essays and miss the intended sequence.

This page gives a recommended first sequence, an alternative reading mode for returning readers, and a simple rule for deciding where a topic belongs.

## ## Beginner sequence (recommended first read)

1. Foundations → Overview  
2. Foundations → Space Is Felt Before It Is Seen  
3. Foundations → Space as Psychological Infrastructure  
4. Mechanisms → Overview  
5. Mechanisms → Slow-Acting Background Regulation  
6. Mechanisms → Visual Density and Cognitive Load  
7. Conditions → Overview  
8. Conditions → When Continuation Is No Longer Neutral  

## Two ways to read

**Mode A — Learn the vocabulary (first visit).**  
Start in Foundations, then read Mechanisms, then Conditions. Treat this like definitions → dynamics → thresholds.

**Mode B — Use it as reference (returning).**  
Start from the most relevant Overview page (Foundations/Mechanisms/Conditions) and follow internal links. You do not need to read linearly once the structure is familiar.

## Where a page belongs

Use this rule:

- If the page defines terms or first principles, it belongs in **Foundations**.  
- If it explains accumulation over time or perceptual mechanics, it belongs in **Mechanisms**.  
- If it describes a threshold state—when “continuation becomes non-neutral”—it belongs in **Conditions**.
