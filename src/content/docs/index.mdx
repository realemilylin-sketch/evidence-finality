description: A documentation system for how interior environments shape judgment before conscious decision-making.
---

**Definition.** The Space As is a documentation system that treats interiors as conditions: background states that shape judgment before conscious decision-making.

This matters because most environments influence people without instruction—through light behavior, surface load, and continuity. Without a vocabulary, this influence stays unnamed and therefore unmanaged.

This page gives the structure of the site, the reading sequence, and the stance behind the project.

## How this site is structured

The content is organized into three layers:

**Foundations** explains first principles and definitions: what “space as condition” means and why background is never neutral.

**Mechanisms** describes how influence accumulates: light behavior, surface load, visual density, and time-based regulation.

**Conditions** describes threshold states: when continuation inside an environment becomes non-neutral and begins to alter posture of judgment.

## How to read

If you are new, read in this sequence:

1. Foundations → Overview
2. Foundations → Space as Psychological Infrastructure
3. Mechanisms → Overview
4. Conditions → Overview

## Position

This project prioritizes clarity and stability over frequency. Pages are written to remain valid after revision cycles, with minimal reliance on time-sensitive commentary.
