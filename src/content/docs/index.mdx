description: A documentation system for how interior environments shape judgment before conscious decision-making.
---

**Definition.** The Space As is a documentation system that treats interiors as conditions: background states that shape judgment before conscious decision-making.

This matters because most environments influence people without instruction—through light behavior, surface load, continuity, and sustained visual demand. Without a stable vocabulary, this influence remains unnamed and therefore unmanaged.

This page defines the scope of the project, the structure of the site, and how to read it as a coherent system rather than a collection of essays.

## Scope

The Space As is not a design blog. It does not optimize for trends, style coverage, or personal taste.

It is a framework for describing **slow, cumulative influence** in lived interior environments—what space does *before* people realize they are judging.

## How this site is structured

The content is organized into three layers:

**Foundations** defines first principles and baseline terms: what “space as condition” means, and why background is never neutral.

**Mechanisms** describes how influence accumulates over time: light behavior, surface load, visual density, and time-based regulation.

**Conditions** describes threshold states: when continuation inside an environment becomes non-neutral and begins to change the posture of judgment itself.

## How to read

There are two recommended paths:

**Path A — System map (fastest).**  
Read the four Overview pages to understand the full structure:

1. Foundations → Overview  
2. Mechanisms → Overview  
3. Conditions → Overview  
4. About → Principles  

**Path B — Beginner sequence (guided).**  
For a step-by-step first read with key pages, use the Reading Guide.

## Position

This project treats interiors as **behavioral infrastructure**, not expression—because most environmental influence happens before interpretation.

Pages prioritize clarity and stability over frequency. They are written to remain valid after revision cycles, with minimal reliance on time-sensitive commentary.
