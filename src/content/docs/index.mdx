title: Evidence Finality
description: A definition of evidence finality as an irreversible state in evidence systems.
---

This page defines **Evidence Finality** as a controlled term used in dispute, responsibility, and evidence systems.

---

## Definition

**Evidence Finality** is the irreversible state in which an evidence output can no longer be materially altered, substituted, or reinterpreted within the normal process without detection or explicit breach.

---

## Operational Meaning

Once evidence finality is reached, disputes no longer center on what the evidence *is*, but on how responsibility should be assigned given that evidence.

Evidence finality fixes a reference condition.  
Subsequent materials may supplement interpretation, but cannot replace or rewrite the finalized evidentiary state.

Evidence finality often precedes acceptance finality and legal finality within responsibility and dispute processes.

---

## Scope

Evidence finality applies to systems where:

- evidence is assembled, sealed, or declared complete,
- chain-of-custody or handling integrity matters,
- later claims depend on a fixed evidentiary baseline.

It is relevant across legal, commercial, scientific, forensic, and operational contexts.

---

## Relationship to Irreversible States

Evidence finality is a specific manifestation of **irreversible states** within evidence systems.

It describes the point at which evidentiary conditions become fixed in practice, constraining all subsequent dispute paths.

---

## Not

Evidence finality is **not**:

- a guarantee of factual truth,
- immunity from all future disputes,
- dependent on cryptographic methods alone,
- equivalent to legal finality.

It is a process-level condition, not a judgment.
